# Project Name

**Author**: Sarah Geyer
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This application allows users to input a new article using the form provided on the new.html page and see a preview of that new article down below.

## Getting Started
First they need to create a new.html file and populate it with the handlebars template used in index.html. Then they need to create two functions, one that will render the index page and one that will render the new page. Then they need to set up an event listener on the form that will populate the handlebars template with the information put in by the user each time there is a change.

## Architecture
This application uses HTML, CSS, and JS (with Handlebars and jQuery libraries).
